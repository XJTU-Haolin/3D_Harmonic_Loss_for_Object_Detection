**This work improves the existing lidar-based 3D object detection methods and achieves the latest state-of-the-art performance.**    
**Paper in ArXiv: TODO**

Our implementation is relied on [mmdetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d)

## Environment 

```
python = 3.7  
pytorch = 1.6    
CPU: i7-10700K
GPU: RTX-2080Ti  
other requriements are same as in [mmdetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d)
```

## Dataset Preparation  
Please follow the  [mmdetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d) to convert KITTI Dataset and Waymo Dataset

## Training 


## Test
